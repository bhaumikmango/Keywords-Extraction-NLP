The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",
            "Climate Change Article": "We often think about human-induced climate change as something that will happen in the future, but it is happening now. Ecosystems and people in the United States and around the world are affected by the ongoing process of climate change today. A collage of typical climate and weather-related events: floods, heatwaves, drought, hurricanes, wildfires and loss of glacial ice. A collage of events related to climate and weather: loss of glacial ice, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and drought. (Image credit: NOAA) Climate change affects the environment in many different ways, including rising temperatures, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and more. These events affect things that we depend upon and value, like water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health. Our changing climate NOAA monitors weather and climate around the world. Here are some of the ways that climate change is affecting our planet.

Show me another fact A complex issue Climate change impacts our society in many different ways. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to spread of disease, death, and damage ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues that result from drought, flooding, and other weather conditions increase the death rate, change food availability, and limit how much a worker can get done, and ultimately the productivity of our economy. Hope for the future There is still time to lessen the impacts and severity of climate change. We already know many of the problems and solutionsoffsite link, and researchers continue to find new ones.  Experts believe we can avoid the worst outcomes by reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible, which will limit warmingoffsite link. To meet this goal, we will have to invest in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth. For example, we will need to continue improving technology and facilities that capture and process renewable energy. Lowering emissions will also benefit human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in expenses related to health. Screenshot of Climate Explorer tool interface.

Water The effects of climate change on our water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives. Patterns of where, when, and how much precipitation falls are changing as temperatures rise. Some areas are experiencing heavier rain events while others are having more droughts. Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century,  precipitation events are stronger, heavier, and more frequent across most of the United States. Drought is also becoming more common, especially in the Western United States. We are using more water during hot weather, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out,  hot weather causes plants to lose, or transpire, more water. Then, farmers must give their crops more water. Snowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use. Snowmelt is particularly important in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow and snow begins to melt earlier in the year. This means that snowpack is less likely to be a reliable source of water. Food Our food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Higher temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for farmers and ranchers. Farmers, ranchers, and researchers can address some of these challenges by adapting their methods or creating and using new technology. But, some changes will be difficult to manage, like human and livestock health. Farmworkers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks. Heat can also harm livestock. Is climate change coming for your French fries? Climate and french fries Fries depend on potatoes, and like all crops, potatoes have a preferred climate. How long will America‚Äôs favorite side dish have a safe spot on our menu? AnchorHuman health Climate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns put lives at risk in many ways: Heat is one of the most deadly weather conditions. As ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause death during the hurricane itself and in the aftermath. Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks. More flooding leads to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, death, and chemical hazards. As geographic ranges of mosquitoes, ticks, and other pests expand, they carry diseases to new locations. The environment Climate change affects all living things, or organisms, and the environment they live in, but not equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is warming at least twice as fast as the global average.  Warming in the Arctic has impacts that are felt across the globe ‚Äî melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramaticallyoffsite link to sea level rise. Sea levels are also rising due to thermal expansion. Higher sea level puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge. Effects of climate change can build upon one another to damage ecosystems. Sea level rise can cause sediment to smother corals. But, coral reefs are also vulnerable to many other effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching and stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive. Some organisms are able to adapt to and even benefit from climate change. Some plants have longer growing seasons or are blooming earlier. But, these changes can happen too fast for other plants and animals to keep up. For example, an earlier blooming plant may depend on a pollinator that does not adapt as quickly. There are also species that have adapted by expanding or shifting their geographic range, meaning they live in new places that used to be too cold or unsuitable in other ways. As a species expands or shifts its range, it may harm other species that already live in the new area. Existing invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks, may also thrive in even more places because of climate change Ocean ecosystems face an additional challenge: ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more acidic, which affects marine life. A screenshot of the Exploring Our Changing Ocean storymap. There are selections for Alaska, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, South Atlantic, and North Atlantic. Exploring our changing ocean: Impacts and response to ocean acidification in the U.S.A.offsite link Interactive StoryMaps showing ocean acidification trends, science activities, community engagement, and policy responses taking place in six U.S. regions Infrastructure Physical infrastructure includes bridges, roads, ports, electrical grids, broadband internet, and other parts of our transportation and communication systems. People often design it to be in use for many years. Because of this, most communities have infrastructure that was designed without climate change in mind. Existing infrastructure may not be able to withstand extreme weather events that bring heavy rains, floods, wind, snow, or temperature changes. Impacts that result from these events occur in many different ways. For example, increased temperatures require more indoor cooling, which can put stress on an energy grid. Sudden heavy rainfall that exceeds storm water drainage capacity can lead to flooding that shuts down highways, major transportation routes, and businesses.",
            "Medical Research": "Potatoes, the third most commonly consumed food crop and the main non-cereal food, contribute a substantial quantity of daily energy.1 Several US guidelines classify potatoes as vegetables.23 Although potatoes contain various nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, potassium, polyphenols, and magnesium, previous research has raised caution about their effects on health.4 The high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes.56 Although the health benefits of most vegetables are widely acknowledged, the association between potato consumption and health outcomes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), remains a subject of debate. The results of previous prospective studies investigating the association between potato consumption and T2D were inconclusive. Whereas some studies have indicated a positive association,89 others found no statistically significant association,10111213 and some even observed an inverse association.14 Similar inconsistencies have been found in meta-analyses evaluating these relations.1516 A recent individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis17 of seven US cohorts found no association with total potato intake but a modest increased risk with fried potato intake. That study did not, however, assess dietary substitutions, which may have an effect on T2D risk. Few studies have estimated the effect on T2D risk of replacing potatoes with alternative carbohydrate sources; though some suggest benefits from replacing potatoes with whole grains and non-starchy vegetables.818 Inconsistent findings may stem from regional differences in potato consumption, variations in methodology (including only baseline versus repeated dietary assessments), inadequate control for confounding variables, and disregard of the potential for reverse causation. Thus, long term observational studies with advanced methodologies and high quality data are needed to clarify these associations. Additionally, substitution analyses are particularly important as the effect of potato consumption might depend on the replacement sources of energy; in contrast with potatoes, whole grains are consistently linked to lower risks of many adverse health outcomes. The extensive data from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS), Nurses‚Äô Health Study II (NHSII), and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), encompassing almost four decades with many repeated assessments of diet and other variables, provide a more precise evaluation of potato and T2D associations than studies with a single, baseline only assessment. Our previous analyses of data from the US health professional cohorts indicated a robust positive association between high potato consumption‚Äîparticularly French fries‚Äîand increased incidence of T2D.18 In the current study, we examined the same three cohorts, including more than 7000 additional people with T2D documented, with extended follow-up, and evaluated the extent to which having only baseline diet assessments, a common limitation in most epidemiological studies, might attenuate associations. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of replacing potatoes with other frequently consumed foods, and explored latency periods along with the possibility of reverse causation. Finally, to inform dietary guidelines, we also conducted an updated dose-response meta-analysis to evaluate the relation between total and specific potato intake and T2D risk and compare the associations of potatoes and whole grains with T2D risk."
